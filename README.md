A simple and efficient version checking mechanism for Flutter applications using GetX Service.

## ✨ Features

- ⏱️ Periodic automatic version checks
- 🔍 Simple version comparison
- 🔔 User notification when an update is available

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/flutter-simple-version-check.git

Install dependencies:
flutter pub get

Run the app:
flutter run


📘 Usage
This project compares your app's current version with a version received from an API endpoint. When a new version is available, a dialog is shown to the user.
Main Components:

VersionService: GetX Service containing the version checking logic.
ApiService: Service used for API calls.
VersionModel: Model holding version information.

🌐 API Requirements
This application requires an API that returns a JSON response in the following format:
json{
  "appVersion": "1.1.1"
}
Ensure your API returns a response in this format. If you're using a different response format, you'll need to update the ApiService class accordingly.
⚠️ Important Note
This project is a simple version checking example and is open for improvement. More comprehensive testing and error handling should be added for production use.
