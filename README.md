Flutter Simple Version Check with GetX
This repo demonstrates a simple version checking mechanism for Flutter applications using GetX Service.
Features

Version checking service using GetX Service
Periodic automatic version checks
Simple version comparison
User notification when an update is available

Setup

Clone the repo:
Copygit clone https://github.com/your_username/flutter-simple-version-check.git

Install dependencies:
Copyflutter pub get

Run the app:
Copyflutter run


Usage
This project compares your app's current version with a version received from an API endpoint. When a new version is available, a dialog is shown to the user.
Main components:

VersionService: GetX Service containing the version checking logic.
ApiService: Service used for API calls.
VersionModel: Model holding version information.

API Requirements
This application requires an API that returns a JSON response in the following format:
jsonCopy{
  "appVersion": "1.1.1"
}
Ensure your API returns a response in this format. If you're using a different response format, you'll need to update the ApiService class accordingly.
Important Note
This project is a simple version checking example and is open for improvement. More comprehensive testing and error handling should be added for production use.
